# UCI_Code-Refactor

## Description 
    Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginning programmer studying at the UCI coding bootcamp. This code was edited to be more accessible to viewers and to make the code more easily understood by fellow developers. I have gone ahead and added semantic HTML elements. In addition, I have also added alt attributes for the different images. Thank you for taking the time to review my code!
